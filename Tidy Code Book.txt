Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (FrequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (TimeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and FrequencyBodyGyroscoperJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (FrequencyBodyAccelerometerMag, tGravityAccMag, FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMag, FrequencyBodyGyroscoperMag, FrequencyBodyGyroscoperJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ, FrequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMag, FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMag, FrequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
